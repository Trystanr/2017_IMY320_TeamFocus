## Introduction:

Oxygen Not Included is an Early Access game developed by Klei Entertainment that revolves
around characters surviving on a colony by gathering supplies. The game presents the user
with different characters, each with their own unique abilities. The goal of the game is to
ensure the survival of the characters by monitoring their vital signs and developing the
colony to continue exploring, with the ultimate goal of reaching the surface.

### Choices:

Key visual aspects of Oxygen Not Included is the use of gas clouds, each symbolizing a level
of threat to the player, as well colour cues from the environment that subtly hint at changes
in the game. A goal of our design is to convey aspects the game represents through the use
of colour in a similar way.


## Colour Scheme:
The predominant colours of the site will be: red, purple, blue and yellow. The choices of these colours are
based on what best represents the themes and symbolisms of the game itself, which will be translated to
a visual language suitable for the website.

The reasoning for each choice is given below:

### Red: 
This colour represents strongly represents danger, particularly in the case of the aforementioned
gas clouds. In a review of the game, Caldwell (2017) states “red gas slowly building up in a rocky pocket
and the hot urine dripping down into the kitchen, were a sign of things to come.” In the context of both
the symbolism of red and what it represents in the game, we felt it important to use it, specifically in
header sections of the website.

### Purple: 
This colour is often associated with mysteriousness. (Incredibleart.org, n.d.), lists several possible
connotations that this colour has, such as “transformation, cruelty, and enlightenment”. These
characteristics encompass the fundamental gameplay loop of Oxygen Not Included so it was an obvious
choice as part of the colour scheme.
### Blue: 
This colour has a duality in its meaning. According to Gross (n.d.), “It is a favourite colour for
companies that wish to convey reliability, trustworthiness and communication (I’m looking at you
Facebook, Twitter and Samsung) and for expressing the authority and officialdom of organizations (oh,
hey there Constable). It is also appreciated for its calming and harmonious qualities being associated with
the sea and sky. However, being associated with the emotional feeling of being ‘blue’ it is also used to
express sadness or depression.” With the goal of the site being advertising the game, the use of blue as
tool for its corporate association is very fitting.
### Yellow: 
“It is the most visible colour from a distance (which is why it’s used for street signs) and
communicates cheerfulness, friendliness, joy and energy” according to Gross (n.d.). With the website, we
felt it important to emphasise the fact that players of the game are optimistic with regards to their hopes
of survival throughout.
### White, particularly the use of white space: 
There is a lot of white space present on our page, and that
serves two functions. According to Hegde (2017), white space improves comprehension. He states “Using
white space evenly makes the content in design easily scannable and significantly improves legibility. A 
study conducted indicates that proper use of white space between lines of paragraphs and its left and
right margins can increase comprehension up to 20%.”


## Fonts:
The font choice for the website is based on the concept of establishing the aesthetic that Oxygen Not
Included creates. We thought it was important to relay the importance of machinery and technology, a
key selling point of the game, and for that reason we chose Roboto and Open Sans. Walker (2017) states
“your typeface is the body language. It’s what helps create that emotional connection which can be so
critical to the sales process.”

## Interactivity:
The following interactivity will be used in the website:

The landing header will be implemented as a carousel. It is a modern technique used to cycle pictures
effectively, particularly in eCommerce cites as noted by Harkness (2018) who states, “most eCommerce
companies are using carousels today, and they aren’t going to disappear overnight.”

In a similar vein, the reviews will slide from left to right, as to not clutter the screen with too much
information (reviews) at once.

An accordion will be used to hide/show the Updates tab of the page. It is a well-established web design
tool that we feel will not only provide good interactivity, but also be visually pleasing. Friedman (2017)
backs this up with the statement, “the accordion is probably the most established workhorse in
responsive design. It’s an immensely useful pattern for progressive disclosure — highlighting important
details of a section and revealing more details upon a tap or click, if necessary. As a result, the design
stays focused and displays critical information first, while everything else is easily accessible.”

## Layout:
Each subsection of the page is divided using small purple dots surrounding the heading text. We felt this
way an appropriate way to visually communicate subsections as it alludes to the oxygen particles of the
game.

The individual subsections will be easily accessible via the navigation bar (burger bar) that will be fixed to
the top of the page.

We intended to create a visual layout with as little clutter as possible. This type of design is best-suited
for advertising a product as it keeps the user’s attention. This statement is backed up by Kayla (2018) who
states “Removing unnecessary distractions from your website creates a more clear, concise, and
streamlined user experience. The easiest way to improve the user experience on your website is to
simplify it.”
